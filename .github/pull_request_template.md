### What does this PR do?

- [ ] Same as pr title

### How did you verify your code works?

- [ ] I manually tested it
- [ ] I wrote automated tests
- [ ] I ran existing test that covers the new code

### A few checks

- [ ] I bumped version, updated change logs, linked issue where needed
- [ ] It's small and/or doesn't need version bump, change log, issue
- [ ] If deps changed I made sure specific versions of dependencies are used instead of ranged or tagged versions
- [ ] If interface changed, I added TypeScript types for the new methods, getters, or setters
